What is vcachefs?
-----------------

Video/Audio Caching Filesystem (vcachefs) is a FUSE-based filesystem for *nix
and Mac OS X that is designed to mirror a remote filesystem while caching a
certain number of files locally. Essentially, its goal is to solve the "iTunes
sucks balls over 802.11" problem. 

The idea is that you will give it a target directory to mirror and a mountpoint,
and you point media apps toward the mountpoint instead of the net filesystem
itself. I am planning to implement two kinds of caches:

	* A file-atomic cache
	* A block-based cache for the first 1k of the file and the STAT struct

The latter allows media apps who are only querying tag information / file stats
to run quickly without requiring the entire file to be on-disk.


To build:
----------
 
# If MacFuse
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig  

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
make && sudo make install

Requires:
	* pkg-config, autotools
	* glib >= 2.9
	* A recent version of FUSE (API >= v27)


To run (only does a simple mirror now, no caching)
-----------------------------------------

./vcachefs /target/mount/point
