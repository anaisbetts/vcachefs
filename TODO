Done:
	* Hello world, build system
	* Simple mirror (pass all through to target)
	* File-based cache
		* Async worker thread saving off files
		* Save off info in fd table
		* Switching from net read to file read mid-file
	* Bookkeeping (grok settings, set up cache directory, etc)

Dropped:

Milestones to 1.0
	* First n*4k cache
		* Save off the first 4k in a separate file, most media apps want
		  to just get the tags (iTunes manages to wreck this when they
		  scan the file for gapless playback though)
	* File-based cache
		* MRU algorithm when we get cache size pressure
		* Add an extra level that is a hash based on the mount location,
		  so that our cache isn't nonsense
	* Extra nonsense
		* All the dumb stuff OS X needs like resource forks

Misc:
	* Volume icon on OS X
	* GUI to set up mounts
	* Write support (super hard, may do passthrough + invalidate all caches)
