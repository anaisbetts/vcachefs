Done:
	* Hello world, build system
	
Milestones to 1.0
	* Simple mirror (pass all through to target)
	* Bookkeeping (grok settings, set up cache directory, etc)
	* File-based cache
		* Async worker thread saving off files
		* Save off info in fd table
		* Switching from net read to file read mid-file
		* MRU algorithm when we get cache size pressure
	* Tag Block cache
		* Mechanism to persist info (bdb? sqlite?)
		* Determine optimal size and info to save
		* Async worker thread saving caches
		* Add support to read/open/etc
	* Extra nonsense
		* All the dumb stuff OS X needs like resource forks

Misc:
	* Volume icon on OS X
	* GUI to set up mounts
	* Write support (super hard, may do passthrough + invalidate all caches)
